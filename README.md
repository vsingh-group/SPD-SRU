This is the code for the paper [A Statistical Recurrent Model on the Manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11204).

This is part of the experiment on the UCF11 dataset.

You can find the UCF11 dataset from http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF_YouTube_Action.php, its own website.

When running the codes, be sure that run Preprocessed_UCF11.py first.

Then run the UCF11_cnn_rnn_for_matrix_batch.py.
